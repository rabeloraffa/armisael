      </h2>

<p>Hello! We are <strong>Team Fureka</strong> and we are a group of students from the New York Institute of Technology who worked on Project Armisael. We are five Electrical Engineering students who came up with different ideas and skills to build a project that we believe it has the potential to change the wearable technology. Please check <a href="teamContactInfo.html">Contact Info</a> for more information in each member. We want to thank the <i><u>Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of NYIT</i></u> for the opportunity to work together; in specifically Dr. N. Sertac Artan, our instructor, Dr. Yoshi Saito, Department Chair, and Dr. Ziqian Dong.  </p>

<a id="the-project" class="anchor" href="#the-project" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Project</h2>

<p>Our project is a three piece combination: the bracelet, the exoskeleton and the mobile application. The Smart Bracelet: Armisael is an innovative design that differs from all the other wearable devices in a very unique way. Our product is focused towards people that wants to have a healthier life, including those who have heart conditions. The main difference of Armisael to the other wearable devices is that our system focus on using the user's heart rate to guide his/hers exercise. Please check <a href="theProject.html">The Project</a> for full details and comments on the project.</p>
