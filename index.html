<p>We are <strong>Team Fureka</strong> and we are a group of students from the New York Institute of Technology who worked on Project Armisael. We are five Electrical Engineering students who came up with different ideas and skills to build a project that has the potential to change the wearable technology. Please check the <a href="http://rabeloraffa.github.io/armisael/team+contact+info/">Team Contact Info</a> for more information in each member.</p>

<a id="the-project" class="anchor" href="#the-project" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Project</h2>

<p>Our project is a three piece combination: the bracelet, the exoskeleton and the mobile application. The Smart Bracelet: Armisael is an innovative design that differs from all the other smart wristbands and watches in a very unique way. Our product is focused towards people that wants to have a healthier life, including those who have heart conditions. The main difference of Armisael to the wearable world is that our system focus on using the user's heart rate to guide his/hers exercise. This is a huge advantage towards our product because allows them to control their health based on their heart conditions.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
