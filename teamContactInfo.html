  Yang Fan showed great accuracy and awesome hardware skills. Chips and bord soldering were very challenging for our project since it required very delicacy in most of the componets. Fan spent most of his time on the Exoskeleton's hardware and soldering test stations of the Bracelet's components. Meet Yang Fan:
